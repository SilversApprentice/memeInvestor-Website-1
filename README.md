# memeInvestor-website

The Meme Investor website will eventually be an interface to manage your investments, firms, etc, and possibly an alternate r/MemeEconomy in the future.
We're building it with Express.js + Handlebars (a good templating engine), and probably using Sequelize as our ORM (DB mapper).
